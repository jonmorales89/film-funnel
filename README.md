## About

FilmFunnel was created during a 48 hour hackathon with two other developers. The application was developed as a single page application that combined three different API's

1. The Movie DB (TMDb)
    - Utilized TMDb api to gather list of movies currently playing in theaters, and genre based search bar.
    - Gathered detailed information and movie poster image.
2. Reddit
    - Upon user selection, movie title would be passed to Reddit API to search and display top comments.
    - Comments filtered by comment length.
3. YouTube
    - Similar to Reddit, upon user selection, movie title would be pased to YouTube API to search and display top movie reviews.
    - YouTube reviews filtered to top 10.
